{"name":"Fastframe.GitHub.io","tagline":"FastFrame Application Framework","body":"# Introducing FastFrame\r\n\r\nFastFrame is an application framework written in PHP that allows for the rapid development of secure and robust applications. By utilizing object-oriented programming, design patterns, and PEAR libraries it allows both small and large development teams to achieve their goals in a fast and efficient manner. It serves as the foundation for several applications, such as Checkout, a program for loaning and reserving all sorts of items and Mayday!, a trouble ticket system that allows departments to track and manage issues/problems.\r\n\r\nBut what is a framework? Think of it as being similar to the frame of a house. By itself it doesn’t do a whole lot – it needs other applications to actually make it useful. However, those applications can be rapidly developed because the framework provides all the basics (and many extras) needed to get a robust application up and running. Furthermore, because all FastFrame applications are built on top of the same framework any fixes or new features applied to the framework will affect all of the applications as well. Finally, the framework is able to tie all the different applications together so that they have a unified look, a menu system, and a way of talking to each other. But what are these great features the FastFrame framework provides?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
